## Summary and Motivation (1–2 paragraphs, 4 pts)

**Project Title:** *Tech Layoffs: Probability of Occurrence, Roles Impacted, and Event Magnitude*

The technology sector has experienced repeated waves of layoffs across multiple industries and regions. To understand this pattern in depth, this project studies **three complementary questions**:  
1) *Probability:* Which company characteristics predict **whether** a firm lays off in a given period?  
2) *Roles:* Which **job roles** (e.g., Engineering, Product, Sales/Marketing, HR/People Ops, Support/Operations) are disproportionately impacted during layoff events?  
3) *Magnitude:* Conditional on a layoff occurring, what factors drive the **number of employees laid off**?  

The study demonstrates STAT 425 competencies in **linear modeling, logistic regression, regularization, ANOVA/ANCOVA, splines, diagnostics, and mixed-effects**. Results can inform workforce-planning discussions and provide a rigorous, reproducible analysis using public data.

## Methods (1–3 paragraphs, 4 pts)

### A) Probability of Layoff (Binary Classification)
- **Unit of analysis:** Company–month panel  
- **Response:** `layoff_event ∈ {0,1}` indicates any layoff by the firm in month *t*.  
- **Predictors:** `employee_count`, `funding_total_usd`, `stage` (seed/early/late/public), `industry` (SaaS, FinTech, Hardware, etc.), `country/region`, and **time splines** for month index.  
- **Models:** Logistic regression (baseline) and **penalized logistic lasso** (`glmnet`) for feature selection and multicollinearity control.  
- **Evaluation:** 5–10 fold CV; **ROC/AUC**, precision/recall; calibration plot; confusion matrix at selected thresholds.  
- **Diagnostics:** Influence diagnostics, separation checks, multicollinearity review, and comparison of with/without splines.

### B) Roles Impacted (ANOVA/ANCOVA and Multinomial Modeling)
- **Objective:** Test whether certain **job roles** are disproportionately affected,accounting the industry.  
- **Role construction:** Derive role labels from event notes/press releases using text rules/regex (e.g., “engineer/dev/data/QA” → *Engineering*; “PM/product” → *Product*; “sales/marketing/advertising” → *Sales/Marketing*; “HR/recruiting/people/talent” → *HR/People*; “support/ops” → *Support/Ops*). Where unavailable, treat as *Unspecified*.  
- **Analyses:**  
  - **Two-way ANOVA/ANCOVA:** Role share (e.g., percent of laid-off employees in a role) ~ `industry` + `stage` + covariates (size/funding).  
  - **Multinomial logistic (optional):** Predict the **most-impacted role** category using firm/industry features.  
- **Diagnostics:** Normality/variance checks for ANOVA residuals; multiple-comparison (Tukey) for role contrasts.

### C) Magnitude of Layoff (Continuous Regression)
- **Response:** `employees_laid_off + 1` for each event.  
- **Predictors:** `employee_count`, `funding_total_usd`, `stage`, `industry`, `country`, **time splines**, and proportions of roles affected (if available) to test compositional influence.  
- **Models:** Multiple linear regression (baseline), **ridge/lasso** regularization; **GLS** with AR(1) if temporal correlation persists; **mixed-effects** with random intercepts for firm or industry if repeated events per firm.  
- **Evaluation & Diagnostics:** CV-RMSE/MAE, Adjusted \(R^2\), AIC/BIC; residual vs fitted, QQ-plot, Cook’s distance; consider WLS if heteroscedasticity detected.

## Data (4 pts)

- **Primary layoff events:** Public tech layoff trackers (Layoffs.fyi mirrors/Kaggle), including: `company`, `date`, `employees_laid_off`, `percentage_laid_off`, `industry`, `country`, and any textual **notes** that may mention **roles**.  
- **Firm features:** Where available, `employee_count` (headcount), `funding_total_usd`, and `stage`. For public firms, supplement headcount from annual filings when possible.  
- **Role labels:** Create using keyword-based tagging from event **notes/press**. Maintain a lookup table for regex patterns → role category. Keep an *Unspecified* bucket to avoid bias.  
- **Panel build (Probability model):** Create company–month grid, mark `layoff_event` if any event occurs that month; left-join firm features; add month index and spline basis.  
- **Cleaning:** Harmonize company names; deduplicate events; winsorize top 1% of numeric predictors; standardize numeric features for penalized models.

## Results (4 pts)

**Anticipated findings:**  
- **Probability:** Larger firms and later-stage companies are more likely to announce a layoff in a given month; industry and time splines capture sectoral cycles. Penalized logistic models expected to improve AUC and yield a concise feature set.  
- **Roles:** HR/People Ops and Support/Ops may show higher proportional impact early in cost-cut cycles; Engineering/Product share may vary by industry and period. ANOVA/ANCOVA should identify statistically significant role contrasts after adjusting for firm size and stage.  
- **Magnitude:** Conditional on occurrence, layoff counts increase with firm size and funding; splines reveal surge periods. Regularization expected to reduce prediction error vs OLS.

## Conclusions (2 pts)

**Research questions to answer:**  
1) Which firm features best predict **whether** a layoff happens?  
2) Which **roles** are disproportionately affected, controlling for size, stage, and industry?  
3) Among layoff events, what drives the **severity** of cuts?  
4) Do time trends and sector differences materially shift these relationships?
